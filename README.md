# Gameblockly
Gameblockly is a fork of [Ardublockly][1], which uses Google's [Blockly][2] in order to allow easier programming.

Gameblockly uses the [Gameduino][3] in order to make playable games.  This version of Gameblockly was specifically developed for the 2017 National Jamboree to teach K-12 students what programming is and introduce computer science into their lives.

See [Ardublockly][1] for instructions on installation and features.  It is generally the same.
