# Gameblockly
Gameblockly is a fork of [Ardublockly][1], which uses Google's [Blockly][2] in order to allow easier programming.

Gameblockly uses the [Gameduino][3] in order to make playable games.  This version of Gameblockly was specifically developed for the 2017 National Jamboree to teach middle through high school aged students what programming is and introduce computer science into their lives.

GameBlockly is intended to be strictly an educational tool to make a game quickly (generic time taken is estimated about ten minutes) while still being a fun game to play and teach the fundamentals of programming.  Thus, GameBlockly is unlike Blockly and ArduBlockly, where a block almost always makes one line.  Each block in GameBlockly is intended for its purpose, where if statements and loops are taught to the best of their abilities.

See [Ardublockly][1] for instructions on installation and features.  It is generally the same.

Notice how the files are running their uncompressed versions and the build will not include GameBlockly files.  This is important if planning on using GameBlockly: continue running on uncompressed files or add that functionality.  Was not needed for my purposes.

Furthermore, the branch is gameblockly.  GameBlockly was first intended to be a branch and only served locally, but then merged into a fork for distribution.  However, for file name's sake, the branch name was kept.
